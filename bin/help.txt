spacejam test-packages [options] [packages-to-test]

[packages-to-test] can be a list of packages with tinytests or munit tests.
It enhances meteor test-packages, by supporting glob wildcards on package names
that are matched against all package names in the meteor app packages
directory.

If not specified, acts the same as meteor test-packages without arguments.

The following options are specific to spacejam:

 --log-level <level>         spacejam log level. One of
                              TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR.

 --root-url <url>            The meteor app ROOT_URL (defaults to the
                              ROOT_URL env var or http://localhost:4096/).

 --mongo-url <url>           The meteor app MONGO_URL (defaults to
                              the MONGO_URL env var, if exists).

 --timeout  <milliseconds>   Total timeout for all tests (defaults to
                              120000 milliseconds, i.e. 2 minutes).

 --meteor-ready-text <text>  The meteor output text that indicates that the
                              app is ready.

 --meteor-error-text <text>  The meteor output text that indicates that the
                              app has errors.


The following options are meteor options and are passed through to meteor (all
are optional):

 --release <release>   The release of Meteor to use.

 --port <port>         The port in which to run your meteor app
                       (defaults to the PORT env var or 4096).

 --settings <file>     Path to a meteor settings file.

 --production          Simulate meteor production mode. Minify and bundle CSS
                       and JS files (defaults to false).


Other commands:

spacejam help - This help text.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Every command line option can also be set by an environment variable of the same name, and a prefix of spacejam_, i.e. spacejam_port.
Note that environment variables have to be lower case, due to the way rc reads them.

Running your package tests without a meteor app
-----------------------------------------------

From within your package folder, run:

spacejam test-packages ./

Exit codes
----------

0 - All the tests have passed in all packages.
1 - spacejam usage error.
2 - At least one test has failed.
3 - The meteor app exited with an error or is crashing.
4 - The tests have timed out.
